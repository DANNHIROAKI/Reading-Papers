abstract = {We study streaming algorithms for the fundamental geometric problem of computing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) on an n-point set X ⊂ ℝd. In the streaming model, the points in X can be added and removed arbitrarily, and the goal is to maintain an approximation in small space. In low dimensions, (1+є) approximations are possible in sublinear space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG ’05]. However, for high dimensional spaces the best known approximation for this problem was \~{O}(logn), due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC ’22], improving on the prior O(log2 n) bound due to [Indyk, STOC ’04] and [Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA ’08]. In this paper, we break the logarithmic barrier, and give the first constant factor sublinear space approximation to Euclidean MST. For any є≥ 1, our algorithm achieves an \~{O}(є−2) approximation in nO(є) space. We complement this by proving that any single pass algorithm which obtains a better than 1.10-approximation must use Ω(√n) space, demonstrating that (1+є) approximations are not possible in high-dimensions, and that our algorithm is tight up to a constant. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that (1+є) approximations are possible in sublinear space with O(1/є) passes over the stream. More generally, for any α ≥ 2, we give a α-pass streaming algorithm which achieves a (1+O(logα + 1/ α є)) approximation in nO(є) dO(1) space. All our streaming algorithms are linear sketches, and therefore extend to the massively-parallel computation model (MPC). Thus, our results imply the first (1+є)-approximation to Euclidean MST in a constant number of rounds in the MPC model. Previously, such a result was only known for low-dimensional space [Andoni, Nikolov, Onak, Yaroslavtsev, STOC ’15], or required either O(logn) rounds or a O(logn) approximation.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of constructing low-distortion embeddings of the Planar Earth-Mover Distance (EMD) into ℓp spaces. EMD is a popular measure of dis-similarity between sets of points, e.g., bags of geometric features. We present a collection of embeddings with the property that their distortion and/or host-space dimension are parametrized by the size (or the sparsity) of the embedded sets s. Our specific results include:• An O(log s)-distortion embedding of EMD over s-subsets into ℓ1−ϵ. This is the first embedding of EMD into a "tractable" ℓp space whose distortion is a function of the sparsity, not the size of the ambient space;• An O(log n)-distortion embedding of EMD into ℓ1 with dimension O(s2 log2 n), where the embedded sets are subsets of an n \texttimes{} n grid. For low values of s this significantly improves over the best previous dimension bound of O(n2) obtained for general sets.},

  abstract = 	 {The Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) is a state-of-the art metric for comparing discrete probability distributions, but its high distinguishability comes at a high cost in computational complexity. Even though linear-complexity approximation algorithms have been proposed to improve its scalability, these algorithms are either limited to vector spaces with only a few dimensions or they become ineffective when the degree of overlap between the probability distributions is high. We propose novel approximation algorithms that overcome both of these limitations, yet still achieve linear time complexity. All our algorithms are data parallel, and therefore, we can take advantage of massively parallel computing engines, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). On the popular text-based 20 Newsgroups dataset, the new algorithms are four orders of magnitude faster than a multi-threaded CPU implementation of Word Mover’s Distance and match its search accuracy. On MNIST images, the new algorithms are four orders of magnitude faster than Cuturi’s GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn’s algorithm while offering a slightly higher search accuracy.}
