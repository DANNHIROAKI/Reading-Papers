Figure 2: FDE Generation Process. Three SimHashes $\left(k_{\text {sim }}=3\right)$ split space into six regions labelled $A-F$ (in high-dimensions $B=2^{k_{\text {sim }}}$, but $B=6$ here since $d=2$ ). $\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{q}}(Q), \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{doc}}(P)$ are shown as $B \times d$ matrices, where the $k$-th row is $\vec{q}_{(k)}, \vec{p}_{(k)}$. The actual FDEs are flattened versions of these matrices. Not shown: inner projections, repetitions, and fill_empty_clusters.

Figure 3: FDE recall vs dimension for varying FDE parameters on MS MARCO. Plots show FDE Recall@100,1k,10k left to right. Recalls@N for exact Chamfer scoring is shown by dotted lines.

Figure 4: Comparison of FDE recall versus brute-force search over Chamfer similarity.

Figure 6: Plots showing the QPS vs. Recall@ 100 for MUVERA on a subset of the BEIR datasets. The different curves are obtained by using different PQ methods on 10240-dimensional FDEs.

Figure 7: Bar plots showing the latency and Recall@ $k$ of MUVERA vs PLAID on a subset of the BEIR datasets. The x-tick labels are formatted as dataset- $k$, i.e., optimizing for Recall@ $k$ on the given dataset.
