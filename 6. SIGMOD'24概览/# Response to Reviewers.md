Comments:
This paper proposes an adaptive hybrid model for stock prediction, leveraging an enhanced VMD, Feature Engineering (FE), Stacked & Distributed (DS) Informer, and an adaptive loss function. The Enhanced LFTSformer model, as a promising hybrid model, is capable of adaptively predicting inherently volatile stock data.
The idea is interesting, but the manuscript needs to be improved. This reviewer feels that the authors failed in several important keys about a research paper.

1. The organization of the introduction section should be improved, namely, presenting subsections with background and contextualization and the motivation and main contributions.
2. The keywords and expressions for the literature search are missing. And with that, several important data are missing, e.g., keywords combination for search, keywords influence by database, etc.
3. How do you model the uncertainty? There are some good references about uncertainty methods, cite bellow refs:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117723  ;   
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2023.109497
https://doi.org/10.1080/15325000802548780 ; 
https://doi.org/10.1080/0952813X.2016.1270359
4. The results should be discussed more thoroughly in light of the existing literature.  This is a very important point to address.
5. There are several grammar and syntax errors that should be corrected.

### Reviewer 2: Response to Comment 1

:one:The Original Structure of the Introduction

1. **Research Background**: Introduction to the importance of time-series prediction in finance and other fields, as well as the necessity of highly performant time-series forecasting models.

2.  **Financial Time-Series Prediction: A Review**: This part presents a review of financial time-series prediction from three progressive perspectives:
    
     - Time-series forecasting based on traditional econometric models.
     - The introduction of deep learning/machine learning in this field.
    - How to enhance the application of deep learning in this area, thereby introducing the research approach of this paper.
   - **Our Research Centre and Article Structure**: A summary of the research objectives of this paper and the structure of the article.
   
   :point_right: The subsequent **Related Works** section focuses on literature related to our research approach and does not overlap or conflict with the review in the Introduction section.

:two:**Changes to the Introduction Section**

1. The overall language has been optimized.

2. Structural improvements have been **highlighted**, redundant parts have been consolidated, and the overall logical flow has been enhanced.
